WARNING:Place:1154 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <clk_50MHz_i> is placed at site <A11>. The corresponding
   BUFGCTRL component <clk_50MHz_i_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site
   <BUFGCTRL_X0Y16>. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB and the
   Clock Buffer if a) the IOB is placed on a Global Clock Capable IOB site that
   has the fastest dedicated path to all BUFGCTRL sites, or b) the IOB is placed
   on a Local Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL
   sites in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why
   this problem exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <clk_50MHz_i.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
